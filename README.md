# Miniflow_MNIST

### Hari Nair


This repository contains the code for a submission for the [Kaggle Digit Recognition competetion](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer).
I have used Udacity's nifty little miniflow implementation for this. I have augmented miniflow by implementing the Softmax and Relu layers. Since cross entropy loss is more in tune with softmax, I have also added an implementation of that. Please note the implementation of softmax and crossentropy derive themselves from my understanding of this [Standford's CS231n class](http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-case-study/). You'll find that I've slightly realigned my network architecture to the same. 

With proper tuning, I was able to achieve an accuracy of 94% with this implementation.
